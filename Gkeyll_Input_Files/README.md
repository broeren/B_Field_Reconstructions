Multi-Spacecraft Magnetic Field Reconstructions: A Cross-Scale Comparison of Methods Broeren, T., Klein, K. G., and TenBarge, J. M., submitted to Earth and Space Sciences, 2023 https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15187

3D five moment turbulence simulation used to test multi-spacecraft reconstruction methods.

`ot3D.lua` is the input file to the simulation 

`gkyl-main.zip` contains the gkeyll source code
